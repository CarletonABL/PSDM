# PSDM

Pseudo-Symbolic Dynamic Modelling matlab package.

PSDM is a numerical method of deriving the equations of motion of an arbitrary rigid body chain, in regressor form.

For usage, see the several examples in the +examples folder. The livescripts give images and full explanation of the process. Equivalent M-file scripts are also available but do not have images or equations.

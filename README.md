# PSDM

Pseudo-Symbolic Dynamic Modelling matlab package.

**The README file has been posted as a PDF, please see the file README.pdf.**

PSDM is a numerical method of deriving the equations of motion of an arbitrary rigid body chain, in regressor form. It is an alternative means of deriving the equations of motion for a rigid, serial kinematic chain. The result is a numerically represented model in a highly organized form, which allows for many symbolic manipulations through numerical methods. This allows for

 - The generation of very fast real time code.
 - Automatic model simplification (to achieve faster evaluation times)
 - Both forward and inverse dynamic modelling in a single derivation and with the same inertial parameter set.
